Ride is a [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). It's named after concatenating R from rust and IDE. It's currently not in a usable state.
If you're looking for something more complete, perhaps [RustDT](http://rustdt.github.io/) for Eclipse, [SolidOak](https://github.com/oakes/SolidOak) or [Rust](https://github.com/rrandom/Brackets-Rust-IDE/) for [brackets](http://brackets.io/) is your thing.
